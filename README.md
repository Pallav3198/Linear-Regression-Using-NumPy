# Linear-Regression-Using-NumPy
The aim is to find a linear function that predicts the response value(y)  as accurately as possible as a function of the feature or independent variable(x).  For generality, we define:  x as feature vector, i.e x = [x_1, x_2, …., x_n],  y as response vector, i.e y = [y_1, y_2, …., y_n]  for n observations (in above example, n=10).
